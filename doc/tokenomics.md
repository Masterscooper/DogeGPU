DogeGPU Tokenomics
Version 1.0
Date: April 1, 2024

Introduction
DogeGPU is a novel cryptocurrency that combines the lighthearted community spirit of Dogecoin with the ASIC-resistant, GPU-friendly mining algorithm of Ravencoin. With ultra-fast 15-second block times and an engaging approach, DogeGPU aims to make cryptocurrency mining accessible and enjoyable. This tokenomics paper outlines the coin's distribution model, emission schedule, and the implementation of a perpetual 2,500 coin tail emission per block.

Token Distribution Overview
    • Initial Block Reward: 1,000,000 DogeGPU coins
    • Block Time: 15 seconds
    • Halving Interval: Every 100,000 blocks
    • Total Halving Events Before Tail Emission: 8
    • Infinite Tail Emission: 2,500 coins per block indefinitely
    • Premine: None
    • Total Supply Before Tail Emission: 199,218,750,000 coins

Emission Schedule
Halving Events
The block reward halves every 100,000 blocks until it reaches the infinite tail emission of 2,500 coins per block starting from block 800,000.

Total Coins Before Infinite Tail Emission
The sum of coins mined before the tail emission starts is:
 Coins DogeGPU coinsTotal Coins​=100,000,000,000+50,000,000,000+25,000,000,000+12,500,000,000+6,250,000,000+3,125,000,000+1,562,500,000+781,250,000=199,218,750,000 DogeGPU coins​

Infinite Tail Emission
Starting from block 800,000, DogeGPU introduces an infinite tail emission of 2,500 coins per block. This means that every block mined after this point will yield a constant reward of 2,500 DogeGPU coins indefinitely.
Purpose of Tail Emission
    • Network Security: Ensures continuous incentives for miners to secure the network.
    • Sustainability: Prevents the decline in miner participation that can occur when block rewards diminish significantly.
    • Economic Stability: Introduces a predictable, low inflation rate.

Token Distribution Mechanics
Mining and Distribution
    • No Premine: DogeGPU starts with zero premined coins, promoting fair distribution.
    • Proof-of-Work Algorithm: Utilizes the PawPoW algorithm (a modified version of Ravencoin's KAWPOW) optimized for GPU mining.
    • Accessibility: GPU-friendly mining allows broader participation compared to ASIC-dominated networks.
Block Time and Transaction Speed
    • 15-Second Block Time: Facilitates fast transaction confirmations, enhancing user experience.
    • High Throughput: Capable of processing a significant number of transactions per second due to rapid block generation.

Economic Implications
Inflation Rate
    • Initial Phase: High inflation due to large block rewards to bootstrap the network.
    • Post-Tail Emission Phase: Inflation rate decreases significantly, stabilizing over time.
Long-Term Supply Growth
    • Controlled Expansion: The infinite tail emission introduces a linear increase in total supply.
    • Predictability: The constant emission rate allows for easy forecasting of future supply.
Miner Incentives
    • Sustained Rewards: Continuous block rewards ensure miners remain incentivized to maintain network security.
    • Decentralization: GPU optimization encourages a wider distribution of mining power.

Visualizing Supply Over Time
To illustrate the emission schedule and total supply growth, imagine a curve that rapidly increases during the initial halving events and then transitions to a steady, linear growth due to the tail emission.
    • Early Years: Sharp increase in total supply.
    • Later Years: Gentle slope representing the infinite tail emission.

Rationale Behind Tokenomics Design
Community Engagement
    • Fun and Humor: Incorporates a light-hearted approach with "pawsitively" amusing elements to foster community spirit.
    • Inclusivity: Encourages participation from users of all levels by eliminating barriers like expensive ASIC equipment.
Security and Sustainability
    • Continuous Mining Incentives: Prevents a sharp drop in miner activity that can compromise network security.
    • Long-Term Vision: Balances initial growth with sustainable practices for longevity.
Economic Fairness
    • No Premine or ICO: Public launch promotes trust and fairness by not allocating coins to founders or investors unfairly.
    • Equitable Distribution: Mining rewards are accessible to anyone with GPU hardware.

Conclusion
DogeGPU's tokenomics are designed to promote a fair, secure, and sustainable cryptocurrency ecosystem. By combining an initial high-reward phase with an infinite tail emission, DogeGPU ensures that miners remain incentivized, the network stays secure, and the community continues to grow. The approach balances rapid early adoption with long-term stability, all while keeping the spirit light and enjoyable—because in the world of DogeGPU, every day is a walk in the park (just watch out for those "blockchain logs")!
